# Assay to determine thermal stability (Tm) of β-glucosidase mutants

This procedure is made to measure stability changes caused by mutations to BglB, which as a Tm of 42-46 C under these conditions. Therefore, we use a gradient of 30-80 C. In general, you can adjust the gradient of temperatures on the thermal cycler to center on the Tm of your protein.

+ qPCR QuantStudio3 (aka Eva)

## Method

### Protein Dilutions 

Dilute your protein using PCR tubes:
1. If your protein yield is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/ml:
Do not dilute protein, load 17.5 uL undiluted protein to each well
2. If your protein yield is 0.1-1 mg/ml:
Dilute protein 2X for a total of 100 uL. Mix 50 uL of protein with 50 uL of protein buffer
3. If your protein yield 1-5 mg/ml:
Dilute protein 10X for a total of 100 uL. Mix 10 uL of protein with 90 uL of protein buffer

### Prepare a solution of 8X Protein Thermal Shift (PTS) dye (1000X) (Cat # 4461146)
You can prep this dilution in a PCR tube or 1.5 mL tube. We make 4 replications/ sample (4 wells)
1. Count the amount of 8X PTS dye you need: samples (n+2) x 4-replications x 2.5 (uL of 8X PTS dye/rxn). *For example: 4 samples +2 x 4 x 2.5 = 60 uL of 8x dye needed for all rxn* 
2. Use M1V1= M2V2 to find how much 1000x PTS dye (M1) you need. *For example: 60uL= V2, 8X= M2, 1000x= M1, find V1 (0.48uL)*
3. Make the 8X PTS dye by diluting 1000X using protein buffer. *For example: 60uL - 0.48 uL of 1000X PTS dye = 59.52 uL of protein buffer.*

### Reaction setup:
Add the compontents in the order listed
1. 17.5 uL of the protein sample 
2. 2.5 uL of diluted 8X PTS dye
3. Pipet each reaction up and down 10 times to mix
4. Cap the plate with MicroAmp optical cap, and spin it at 1000 rpm for 1 min.
5. Turn the qPCR on, and load the Bagel_Thermal_protocal file and name your experiments (*For example: Peishan Mutant-Batch1 MM/DD/YY)*. 

### Program set up:
1. Open QuantaStudio Analysis Software
2. Open existing experiment
3. Click *Computer* > *AB SW&Data* > load *Standard_BAGEL_Thermo.edt* file
4. Give the exp a name (_PH_mutant1_date)_ and descriptions of the exp. Click *next*.
5. No change to the *Experiment Method*, click *next*
6. Click Next again at the *Assign Targets and Samples*
7. Save the data under *Computer* > *AB SW&DATA* > *Bagel_thermo_data* folder
8. Load your samples and close the qPCR and begin the run by clicking *Start Run*
It should take about 20 minutes for the run to complete. Make sure to take the plate out after completion.

### Analyzing and Retrieving the data
1. On Desktop, click on *Protein Thermal Shift Software*
2. Click *Create Study* on the very top
3. Click *Experiment files*, then click import on the upper left corner and load .eds file for data analysis.
4. Define your samples by cliking *assign* sample.
5. Your WT should be around 42C to 46C. Check in with Peishan to verify the results.
6. Export the file by clicking *Export* on the left. On the same left column, click *Analysis data*
7. In the Export directory (Top column), change the location to a USB drive. 
8. Change the file type to .csv (not .txt) and also file name.
9. Then click *export* on the top right corner.
