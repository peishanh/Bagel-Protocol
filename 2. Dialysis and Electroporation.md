## Dialyze DNA
1. Add enough diH2O to an empty Petri dish to cover the entire dish with a layer of water
2. Remove the blue paper-like protective covers from either side of a .025um membrane filter
3. Use a pen to mark positions along the edge of the membrane where your samples will go (you can usually get about 8 around the edge)
3. Place the filter into the diH2O so that it is flat and there is no water sitting on the surface of the membrane
4. DO NOT SUBMERGE!
5. CAREFULLY pipette the entire 2-4uL reaction onto the designated spots (putting too much pressure on the membrane can flood it and lose your samples)
6. Cover and let dialyze for 40+ minutes (45 minutes is generally a good amount of time) 
   * If you plan to transform the same day that you dialyze I would recommend getting an ice bucket and starting to thaw electrocompetent *DH5a* cells from the -80 fridge. NOTE: NEVER put leftover comp cell back in the -80 fridge.
7. After the dialysis, CAREFULLY remove the reaction and pipette into the bottom of labeled PCR tubes

## Electroporation
1. Remove 0.1cm electroporation cuvettes for each mutant from individual packaging and KEEP ON ICE
2. Aquire electro competent *DH5a* cells from the -80 fridge and put them on ice
3. Once thawed, add 25uL of cells to the very bottom (between the two silver plates) in the corner where there is no notch on the outside wall of the cuvette.
4. Add 2uL of dialized DNA from the previous step to the droplet (MAKE SURE THEY TOUCH AND BECOME ONE DROPLET)
4. Place into BioRad electroporater (they only fit in 1 way because of the notch) set to "Bacteria" and "Time ms" and hit
“Pulse”. The pulase value should be greater than 4.0.
5. Use a p200 to IMMEDIATLEY add 200uL of media (TB, NO antibiotic) into the bottom of the crevice in the cuvette to extract cells
6. Transfer cells and TB to a fresh labeled 15 mL tube
7. Incubate 37 degrees with shaking for ~1hr
8. Plate all 200uL on individual plates
9. Shake plates to spread cells across entire agarose surface
10. Turn plates so agar side is up and incubate at 37 degrees overnight
