# After Kunkel mutagenesis 

### Materials: 
1. Plates from the end of Kunkel.
2. 15 mL culture tube
3. TB broth
4. Kanamycins (Bagel substrate box)

### Day 1. Make sure to use sterile technique (bunsen burner + spray areas down with ethanol or IPA)
1. Make a master solution of TB broth with kanamycins (n +2):
For examples: If you have 18 samples +2, pour 20 mL of TB broth in a 50 mL falcon tube and add 20 uL (1000X dilution) of Kanamycin on to the TB broth.
2. From each plates containing your mutants, pick 3 different individual colonies and inoculate it into a seperate 15mL falcon tube containing 2mL of TB broth with 2uL of kanamycin. ***This steps require sterile technique
Incubate at 37*C for overnight. 

For the culture plate, seal them with parafilm and store them in 4 C cold room.

### Notes:
If you have difficulties picking an individual colony from a plate, restreaks the plate and allow it to grow over night @ 37 C.

### Day 2
1. If you are not ready to perform the mini-prep step, spin down your cells @4000 prm for 10 min (dispose of the supernatant) 
2. Store tubes in -20*C.
3. Otherwise, review and follow the miniprep procedures to extract your DNA. 
4. Once you have miniprep all your samples, set up a sequencing plate.
