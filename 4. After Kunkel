## After Kunkel Mutagenesis
You should have the mutant plates (in the 37 C room or 4 C cold room) of your mutants from the previous Kunkel step.   

Materials:
1. Plates from the end of kunkel
2. 15 mL culture tube
3. Kanamycins (Bagel substrate box)
4. Terrific broth (TB)

## Day 1: Please use sterile technique (Bunsen burner/ spray areas down with ethanol or IPA)
1. Make a master solution of TB with kanamycins ( n samples +2)
For example: If you have 18 samples +2, pour 20 mL of TB in a 50 mL falcon tube and add 20 uL (1000X dilution) of Kanamycin on to the TB. 
2. From each plates containing your mutants, pick 3 different individual colonies and inoculate it into the a separate 15 mL falcon tube containing the TB with Kan.
3. Incubate at 37 C shaker overnight.
For the culture plate, seal them with parafilm and store them in 4 C cold room.

## Notes
If you have difficulties picking an individual colony from a plate, restreaks the plate and allow it to grow over night @ 37 C.

## Day 2
1. If you are not ready to perform the mini-prep step, spin down your cells @4000 prm for 10 min (dispose of the supernatant) 
2. Store tubes in -20*C.
3. Otherwise, review and follow the miniprep procedures to extract your DNA. 
4. Once you have miniprep all your samples, set up a sequencing plate. 

## Sequencing plate setup
1. Add your samples starting from top to bottom (A to H) and then across (1 to 12). For example: (A1, B1, C1...A3, B3, C3)
2. For each tube (sample) you have, add 12 uL of your sample to two wells (12 uL/ well) 
3. Seal the plate with PCR caps
