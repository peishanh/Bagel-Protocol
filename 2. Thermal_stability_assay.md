# Assay to determine functional thermal stability of β-glucosidase mutants

This procedure is made to measure stability changes caused by mutations to BglB, which as a Tm of 40-42 C under these conditions. Therefore, we use a gradient of 20-80 C. In general, you can adjust the gradient of temperatures on the thermal cycler to center on the Tm of your protein. 

## Materials

Material | Concentration | Amount per sample
---------|---------------|------------------
Purified protein | about 1 mg/mL | 140 µL
PCR tube | | 1
Optical 96-well assay plate | | 1
Optical plate seal | | 1
Protein buffer | | < 2 mL
Protein Thermal shift Dye kit | | < 1 uL

## Mise en place

+ P10 and P100 pipet and tips
+ qPCR QuantStudio3 (aka Eva)

## Method

### Protein Dilutions 

Dilute your protein using PCR tubes:
1. If your protein yield is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/ml:
Do not dilute protein, load 17.5 uL undiluted protein to each well
2. If your protein yield is 0.1-1 mg/ml:
Dilute protein 2X for a total of 100 uL. Mix 50 uL of protein with 50 uL of protein buffer
3. If your protein yield 1-5 mg/ml:
Dilute protein 10X for a total of 100 uL. Mix 10 uL of protein with 90 uL of protein buffer

### Prepare a solution of 8X Protein Thermal Shift (PTS) dye (1000X) (Cat # 4461146)
You can prep this dilution in a PCR tube or 1.5 mL tube
1. Use 0.56 uL of PTS dye
2. Dilute with 49.44 uL of protein buffer

This is enough for 4 samples (4 replicates per sample)

### Reaction setup:
Add the compontents in the order listed
1. 17.5 uL of the protein sample 
2. 2.5 uL of diluted 8X PTS dye
3. Pipet each reaction up and down 10 times to mix
4. Seal the plate with MicroAmp optical adhesive seal, and spin it at 1000 rpm for 1 min.
5. Place the plate on ice until you are ready to run the reaction.
6. Turn the qPCR on, and load the Bagel_Thermal_protocal file. 

### Program set up:
1. Open QuantaStudio Analysis Software
2. Open existing experiment
3. Click *Computer* > *AB SW&Data* > load *Standard_BAGEL_Thermo.edt* file
4. Give the exp a name (_PH_mutant1_date)_ and descriptions of the exp. Click *next*.
5. No change to the *Experiment Method*, click *next*
6. Click Next again at the *Assign Targets and Samples*
7. Save the data under *Computer* > *AB SW&DATA* > *Bagel_thermo_data* folder
8. Load your samples and close the qPCR and begin the run by clicking *Start Run*
It should take about 30 minutes for the run to complete. Make sure to take the plate out after completion.

### Analyzing and Retriving the data
1. On Desktop, click on *Protein Thermal Shift Software*
2. Click *Open Study* on the very top
3. The file should be automatically uploaded. If is not, then import the .eds file for data analysis.
4. Export the file by clicking *Export* on the left. On the same left column, click *Analysis data*
5. In the Export directory (Top column), change the location to a USB drive. 
6. Change the file type to .csv (not .txt) and also file name.
7. Then click *export* on the top right corner.
