## Dialyze DNA
1. Add enought diH2O to an empty Petri dish until it is mostly full
2. Remove the blue paper-like protective covers from either side of a .025um membrane filter
3. Use a pen to mark positions along the edge of the membrane where your samples will go (you can usually get about 8 around the edge)
3. Place the filter into the diH2O so that it is flat and there is no water sitting on the surface of the membrane
4. DO NOT SUBMERGE!
5. CAREFULLY pipette the entire 5uL reaction onto the designated spots (putting too much pressure on the membrane can flood it and lose your samples)
6. Cover and let dialyze for 20+ minutes
    * If you plan to transform the same day that you dialyze I would recommend getting an ice bucket and starting to thaw electrocompetent DH5a cells from the -80 fridge.
7. After the dialysis, CAREFULLY remove the reaction and pipette into the bottom of labeled PCR tubes

## Electroporation
1. Open 0.1cm electroporation cuvettes  and KEEP ON ICE
b. Electroporate
ii. Add 30uL of electro competent BL21(DE3)* cells (Competent Cell Rack, Box labeled
“BL21*-ELECTROCOMP”, tubes labeled E*)
iii. Place into BioRad electroporater (only fit in 1 way) set to Bacteria and hit
“Pulse”
iv. IMMEDIATLEY add 200uL of media (TB or LB, NO antibiotic) into the
cuvette to extract cells, transfer to a fresh strip tube or PCR plate.

c. Recover and Plate
i. Incubate 37deg for ~1hr
ii. On individual plates (not sure how to get around this) plate out ~200uL of each
reaction

1. I find it works best to do 12 plates at a time
a. Add ~10 glass beads/plate
b. Add the 200uL of solution
c. Shake to spread
d. Turn plate and tap so beads are transferred to the lid, than pour
out beads into 70% EtOH filled beaker.
e. Move to the next row.
iii. Dry plates at 37deg for ½ hr, lid-side up.
iv. Turn plates so agar side is up and incubate at 37deg overnight
