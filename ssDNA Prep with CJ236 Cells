#ssDNA Prep with CJ236 Cells

1. Produce ssDNA (RECOMNEDED TO DO IN TRIPLICATE! SEE NOTE AT END OF SECTION 2)
  a. Transform plasmid into chemically competent CJ236 cells (initial stock is free from NEB, make your own from there. Any standard chem comp method will work).
    i. -Plate onto a Chlor+YOUR ANTIBIOTIC plate and incubate overnight at 37 0 C.
b. Inoculate 6 colonies into 3ml of LB + YOUR antibiotic. (NO chlor here per NEB instructions)
c. Grow for 4-6 hours at 37 0 C, shaking at 200rpm (until cloudy).
d. Add 3ul of M13K07 helper phage.
e. Continue growing for 1 hour at 37 0 C, shaking at 200rpm.
f. Expand culture by diluting 1ml into 50ml of LB + antibiotic in 250ml flask.
g. Grow overnight at 37 0 C, shaking at 200rpm.
2. Harvesting ssDNA
a. Spin down overnight culture in sterile 50ml Falcon tube at 7000rpm for 20 minutes at 4 0 C.
b. Transfer supernatant (contains phage) to a new sterile 50ml Falcon tube.
c. Add 10ml 20% PEG/2.5M NaCl and mix thoroughly and incubate on ice for 45 minutes.
d. Spin down the phage at 7000rpm for 20 minutes at 4 0 C.
e. Decant liquid and let tube stand upright to drain off the rest of the liquid.
f. Resuspend the pellet in 2ml 1xPBS. Vortexing is okay.
g. Spin at 14,000rpm for 5 minutes.
h. Transfer the supernatant to new microfuge tubes with 300ul PEG/NaCl.
i. Vortex and incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
j. Spin down phage at 14,000rpm for 2 minutes.
k. Pipette off supernatant. Do a second quick spin to collect residual liquid and pipette it off.
l. Resuspend the pellet (phage) in 1ml 1xPBS.
m. Spin down at 14,000rpm for 5 minutes.
n. Transfer the supernatant (phage) to a new microfuge tube.
o. Harvesting ssDNA from Phage using Qiagen Qiaprep M13 kit (#27704)
i. DO NOT SPIN OVER 8000rpm when using this kit!
ii. Final solution should be greater than 20ng/uL. If not try again; ssDNA can randomly
fail so often it is best to make 2 batches in parallel (works as a nice counter balance
as well).
