## After After DNA dialysis and electroporation
You should have the mutant plates (in the 37 C room or 4 C cold room) of your mutants from the previous Kunkel step (Step 2).   

Materials:
1. Plates from the end of kunkel
2. 15 mL culture tube
3. Kanamycins (Bagel substrate box)
4. Terrific broth (TB)

## Day 1: Please use sterile technique (Bunsen burner/ spray areas down with 70% ethanol or 70% IPA)
1. Make a master solution of TB with kanamycins ( n samples +1)
For example: If you have (9 samples +1)*2mL = 20mL TB, pour 20 mL of TB in a 50 mL falcon tube and add 20 uL (1000X dilution) of Kanamycin on to the TB. 
2. From each plates containing your mutants, pick 3 different individual colonies and inoculate it into the a separate 15 mL falcon tube containing 2mL TB with Kan.
3. Incubate at 37 C shaker overnight.
For the culture plate, seal them with parafilm and store them in 4 C cold room.

## Notes
If you have difficulties picking an individual colony from a plate, restreaks the plate and allow it to grow over night @ 37 C.

## Day 2
1. If you are not ready to perform the mini-prep step, spin down your cells @4000 rpm for 10 min (dispose of the supernatant) 
2. Store tubes in -20*C.
3. Otherwise, review and follow the miniprep procedures to extract your DNA. 
4. Once you have miniprep all your samples, set up a sequencing plate. 

## Find the concentration of your DNA sample before adding it to your sequencing plate.

1. Open the Gen5 application
2. Under Take3 Application > select nucleic acid quantification
3. Make sure to change the setting to detect dsDNA. 
4. Any samples that falls between 40-50 ng/uL might causes low sequence quality reads. 
Anything that's less 40ug/uL, you should most likely regrow the samples and re-miniprep. 
Anything that is higher than 180 ng/uL you should dilute the sample (M1V1= M2V2) to around 80-120 ng/uL. 


## Sequencing plate setup (Starts from A1 in a new plate)
A1  | A2  | A3  | Etc. 
----|-----|-----|---- 
B1  | B2  | B3  | Etc
C1  | C2  | C3  | Etc
D1  | D2  | D3  | Etc
Etc | Etc | Etc | Etc
Note: Never put anything at G12 and H12!

1. Add your samples starting from top to bottom (A1 to H1) 
2. For each tube (sample) you have, add 12 uL of your sample to two wells (12 uL/ well) 
3. Seal the plate with PCR caps and seal the rest of the plate that's not been used with clear seal. Store in -20. 

Once your sequence results came back, then you can move on to Protein production.
